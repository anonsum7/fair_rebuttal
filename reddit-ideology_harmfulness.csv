11,"There is a difference between people referring to themselves as *social-democrat* while being centrists and actual *social-democrats.*

Orthodox social-democracy entails the following:

\-**Much higher taxes** for the wealthy and big corporations

\-A **strong** welfare state

\-Better working conditions for workers (Higher salaries, more vacations, better general treatment at work)

\-Strong unions

\-Strong regulations on big corporations **in order to avoid monopolies and abuses**

&x200B;

***Social-democrats*** **are your allies, not your enemies**. Even if *social-democratic* policies get passed into motion, it is **a lot closer in terms of values to** ***socialism*** **than our current system**. I am by no means saying that it would be perfect, but it would be better.

**A revolution would be the best case scenario** but when is it happening? Tomorrow? In a week? In a year? 10 years?

Until then ***what can we do to help the left***, the working class, the most vulnerable members in our society? If a revolution is not happening as of right now, the only thing us, leftists, can do in the meantime is to do something to improve things step by step. My point is that it would be best for a revolution to happen but what do we do until then? **Doing nothing and alienating other parts of the left is just as bad as helping the right.**

***Social-democrats*** **move in the same direction as socialists on the economical and social spectrum.** We should work towards **building unity throughout the entire left** because at the end of the day, they want the same thing but simply have a different solution to it. Everyone in **the left wants the workers to be better treated than currently, human prosperity in the long term, social justice as well as stopping climate change.** Any social-democrat agrees to those, as any democratic socialist, socialist or communist would. It is only by working together in solidarity that we will achieve our goals.

It is also to note that many socialists used to be social-democrats. Nothing is a lost cause.","There is a distinction between individuals who identify as ""social-democrat"" while holding centrist views and those who are true social democrats.

Genuine social-democracy includes:

- Significantly higher taxes for the wealthy and large corporations
- A robust welfare state
- Improved working conditions for employees (such as higher wages, more time off, and better treatment in the workplace)
- Strong labor unions
- Strict regulations on large corporations to prevent monopolies and abuses

Social democrats should be seen as allies, not enemies. While social-democratic policies may not be perfect, they are much closer to socialism than our current system. A revolution may be ideal, but in the meantime, we must work towards incremental progress to help the left and support the most vulnerable in society.

Collaboration and unity on the left are essential, as all leftists ultimately desire better treatment for workers, human flourishing, social justice, and addressing climate change. Building solidarity and working together is the key to achieving these common goals. It is important to remember that many socialists have transitioned from being social-democrats, showing that change is always possible.",1

13,"Excellent link, thank you. I'm adding it to similar articles I've saved. Defenders of Garland point to his Jan 6 statements about following the evidence and the law, but that statement, when read, was very carefully crafted to be vague about who exactly would actually be prosecuted.

He just made a statement recently that further specifies going after even those who weren't there on Jan 6, if they're found to have been involved. But I still think it skirts specifics. He needs to clearly say he's willing to file charges against sitting members of Congress and even cabinet members or the ex president himself.

It costs nothing to state what should be an obvious statement of law - that no one is above it. And he hasn't.

The Justice Dept hasn't reached out to Georgia's sec of state‚Äôs office about Trump asking to ‚Äúfind‚Äù enough votes to reverse his defeat. Yet a local district attorney *is* investigating it. Why aren't journalists asking spokespeople for JD about that?

Additionally why hasn't the Trump campaign received requests for documents and interviews from the FBI or Justice Department related to Jan 6?

Why haven't federal prosecutors attempted to interview those who have knowledge that Trump considered a plan to put in an AG that was more pliable about going after his claims about massive voter fraud?

Every talking head on national news, point to Trump's speeches where he aggressively encouraged protestors to go to the capitol, and say the AG would have a hard time using that to prove he directly incited the insurrection. 

But none of them talk about what he *did*. Pressuring the Georgia sec of state, his plan to install a puppet AG, and many other acts *would* be enough to establish that. And Garland is apparently making no effort to investigate those.

Thanks again for that link, and for trying to raise more awareness of the unwillingness or ineptitude of this AG to go after those at the top.","Thank you for sharing that link. I have added it to my collection of similar articles. Supporters of Garland reference his statements on Jan 6 about following evidence and the law, but these statements are carefully crafted to be vague about who would actually be prosecuted.

It should be a given that no one is above the law, but Garland has not explicitly stated this. Journalists should question the Justice Department about their lack of action regarding Trump's request to ""find"" votes in Georgia and why federal prosecutors have not interviewed individuals familiar with Trump's plan to appoint a compliant Attorney General.

Many news commentators discuss Trump's speeches but fail to address his actions in pressuring officials or attempting to manipulate the legal system. Garland seems to be neglecting these crucial aspects in his investigations.

16,"> So even though Democrats held a majority in the house, the republicans controlled more state delegations in the house.

Republicans are using this divide to keep power. Everything in our elections favors land over population. While conservatives are a minority, they are far more spread out. Which is why Democrats win the popular vote but Republicans win the elections so often - both in national and state races. 

Gerrymandering is just a multiplier for this effect. In NC, Dems got over 50% of the vote for state legislature but the state is so gerrymandered that Republicans actually increased the number of seats they got, which is around 60%. They then use that majority to further gerrymander and further disenfranchise voters. In some red states they are even using gerrymandered majorities to overturn democratic election results.","Despite having a majority in the house, Democrats were at a disadvantage as Republicans controlled more state delegations. This imbalance is being exploited by Republicans to maintain power, as our electoral system prioritizes land over population. While conservatives may be a minority, their influence is widespread, resulting in Republicans often winning elections despite losing the popular vote. Gerrymandering only exacerbates this issue, as seen in instances like North Carolina where Democrats received over 50% of the vote for the state legislature but Republicans were able to secure around 60% of the seats due to gerrymandering. This advantage is then used to perpetuate further gerrymandering and suppress voters. In some states, gerrymandered majorities are even being used to overturn democratic election outcomes.",1

Another thing to keep in mind is that most Dem-Socs are Gradualists. Some like MLK have been pacifists, but that isn't universal. 

Unlike say, Anarchists, we certainly participate in electoral politics. But, despite what some may think, we don't view elections as the only way to do politics. Look at MLK. He was non-violent, but he broke laws all the time during his struggles. He helped unionize workers. 

Just some thoughts I've had on the subject.","As a Democratic Socialist, I approach the topic from that perspective. The way you explain Democratic Socialism, with a focus on nationalization of key industries alongside worker co-ops, aligns with my views and those of many others in the movement.

It is also worth noting that most Democratic Socialists are gradualists and may differ in their approaches to activism. While some, like MLK, have embraced pacifism, this is not a universal characteristic among all Dem-Socs.

Unlike Anarchists, Democratic Socialists actively participate in electoral politics. However, it is important to understand that elections are not the only avenue for political engagement within the movement.

If we could nail down some statistics everyone could agree on we can identify the issues with welfare and find some common ground. One thing is for sure, nothing is perfect and everything can be made better. If welfare was a company that made money based on how effectively they lifted people out of poverty the entire system would become much much more efficient and effective. If board members and data analysts crunched numbers to maximize profits by getting help to every person that needed it and getting them back into a stable position and off welfare the system would be tweaked and streamlined to be as effective as it could be. This is far from our current system. If someone is on welfare and they get a part time job they lose all of their benefits, wouldn't it make sense to ween them off, perhaps for every dollar they make they lose .50c of welfare that way having a job and welfare is actually more profitable than just a job for people struggling like you're talking about. This is a simple fix and yet it's not implemented because the goal of welfare isn't to help people it's to give them just enough to not starve but to keep them poor. Poor people vote for the party promising to help them, the poor aren't going to vote red when they are told by the blue media the red want to take away welfare entirely. Then we can address issues like how welfare is a safety net that causes more people to jump into it than to continue to struggle and climb out of a hard situation. Cultural differences matter, a lot. In most Asian cultures, education and family are above all else. Studying for test and sticking to marriage is a very high priority. Most people on welfare don't have these Cultural norms, I didn't. Mothers that are sick of fighting with fathers can always have the safety net of welfare to rely on and we can see the amount of single mother households growing along with the number of welfare cases. No system is perfect so its a situation. Does it help people? Yes. Does it also have some unintended effects that increasethe amount of people on it? Also yes. 

So then why would we want government intervention in so many other aspects of our lives when so many things they have their hands in a noticeably worse? 

If we could have real conversations with real reliable numbers and non-biased studies then we can compromise on issues. The problem is polarization and it's intended to divide. I might be right of center and you might be left of center (for argument sake, I'm not assuming) and if the information was accurate from both sides we could compromise and even if we have different opinions we could easily find ways to make things better for Americans for the most part. We have to understand there will always be victims. But the information is unreliable, biased, filled with rhetoric and nothing seems to actually help and only make disagreements more hostile.","Disagreements can often be resolved if all information is readily available and media and tech companies do not control the flow of information. For example, when discussing welfare, identifying common ground through agreed-upon statistics can help pinpoint issues and lead to improvements. It is important to acknowledge that no system is perfect and there is always room for improvement. 

If welfare operated like a profit-driven company, focusing on effectively lifting people out of poverty, it could become more efficient and effective. By implementing measures such as gradually reducing benefits as individuals become more financially stable, the system could be optimized to better assist those in need. However, the current welfare system often perpetuates poverty instead of truly helping individuals climb out of it.

Cultural differences also play a significant role in welfare utilization, with certain cultural norms impacting the level of reliance on welfare. It is evident that government intervention in various aspects of society may not always yield positive results, highlighting the importance of informed discussions based on reliable data and unbiased studies. 

Overall, finding common ground and compromise on issues requires accurate information from all perspectives, rather than polarizing rhetoric. By fostering open dialogue and seeking ways to improve systems for the benefit of all individuals, we can work towards a more harmonious society.",1
