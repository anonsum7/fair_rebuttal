It made her furious when they would take a person in crisis (say suicidal), but were forced to release them within 24-48 hours even if the entire staff would vouch for the long term mental illness.

Fear of institutions, partly by liberal ideology, has left millions of mentally unstable people on the streets of American cities nationwide.   Of course on the Republican side, one's mental illness is a personal problem not a social one.   It's not the Republican party's concern.

The fear of institutions, influenced in part by liberal ideology, has led to numerous mentally unstable individuals being left on the streets of cities across America. On the flip side, Republicans view mental illness as a personal issue rather than a societal one, and do not seem to prioritize addressing it. This partisan divide hinders rational problem-solving in this area. If anyone can provide me with a Republican plan for mental illness treatment, please do share.",1
