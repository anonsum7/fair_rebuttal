""""Let there be no doubts: no other topic is more important for the life of the church,"" said the cardinal. ""If the church is not committed to child protection, our efforts at evangelization will be to no effect; we will lose the trust of our people and gain the opprobrium of the world.""""

2:  The church's leadership has ALREADY lost the trust of many, if not most of its people.

12,"agape is not opposed to eros (except in the philosophical line up of Nygren, where he is talking about total economies of love, contrasting the Platonic eros philosophy with the Christian agape economy; the topic of that famous book is not eros in the sexual sense). The verb agapeo has been used in sexual contexts in Greek and the word eros has been used for love of Christ in Christian writers such as St Ignatius of Antioch and Origen. Agapeic living out of sexuality is found in the NT in the case of marriage and of chaste friendship, and there is a tolerant outlook on prostitution (in the gospels) and on homosexual relations in at least one case (the Centurion of Matthew 8); Paul also plays with the sexually loaded term khresis in his letter to Philemon.","Agape and eros are not necessarily conflicting, as shown by Nygren's examination of love economies in his philosophical work. While Nygren contrasts Platonic eros with Christian agape, it is important to note that his discussion does not focus on eros in a purely sexual sense. The verb agapeo has been used in Greek texts in sexual contexts, and Christian writers like St. Ignatius of Antioch and Origen have used the word eros to describe their love for Christ. The New Testament also presents instances of agapeic expressions of sexuality, such as in marriage and chaste friendships. Additionally, there is a tolerant attitude towards prostitution in the gospels, and even an example of acceptance of homosexual relations in the case of the Centurion in Matthew 8. Paul also incorporates the sexually charged term khresis in his letter to Philemon.",1

17,"The biggest single tax avoidance issue is builders who either build or renovate a property and then live in it just long enough to claim it as a personal residence and pay no tax. The solution is to allow only one tax free transaction every 10 years.

The third problem is with those that cheat the system by investing through relatives or who simply do not report profits from the sales of investment and second homes.

26,"Catholics  had been were taught that living morally was fulfilled by obeying the law, either the 10 Commandments--divine law or the commandments of the Church---ecclesial laws].  Thomist theology included the 'natural laws' that flowed from observation of the created order,  expressing the moral teaching of the Church on sex, contraception, homosexuality, and social justice.   Breaking that law made the action sinful, and the offender liable to a whole slew of punishments [which the Church drew from the Bible or from Natural Law], seen as appropriate punishments to curb bad behavior.
Catholic theology has moved from this legal model of understanding  moral life and sin.  The 'Crime and Punishment' view is deficient in many ways.  The demands of being a faithful follower of Jesus, living according to the vision and values of the gospel, challenge us in ways that can never be adequately prescribed by law.  The Bible is a record of God's graciousness to us, not a collection of do/don'ts.","In the past, Catholics were taught that living morally meant following either divine laws (like the 10 Commandments) or ecclesial laws set by the Church. Thomist theology also emphasized natural laws based on observation of the world, guiding teachings on sex, contraception, homosexuality, and social justice. Breaking these laws was seen as sinful and punishable according to biblical or natural law standards.

However, Catholic theology has since evolved from this legalistic approach to moral life and sin. The focus on 'Crime and Punishment' is now seen as limited. Being a faithful follower of Jesus requires a deeper understanding of the gospel's vision and values that cannot always be captured by laws. The Bible is seen as a testament to God's grace, rather than a strict rulebook.",1
